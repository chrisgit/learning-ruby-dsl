Chef Style DSL (advanced)
=========================
This program demonstrates (roughly) how the Chef DSL works. 
This version is named advanced because it starts to break out the code into folders.
The code is written in long hand form, no meta programming whatsoever/
This demo is to de-mystify how the DSL works and to show that when the DSL is used a method is called and will recieve a block.

Requirements
------------
Needs Ruby, the easiest way to obtain this for Linux or Windows is to install ChefDK (https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)

Usage
-----
Change to the folder where the source code is and run basic_dsl.rb with ruby
#### ruby basic_dsl.rb
