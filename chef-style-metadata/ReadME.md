Chef Style DSL (metadata)
=========================
This program demonstrates (roughly) how the Chef DSL works. 
The idea of this demo was to reduce the amount of code duplication and show some use of metaprogramming.
For more information about metaprogramming I recommend the book Metaprogramming Ruby by Paolo Perrotta.

Requirements

Needs Ruby, the easiest way to obtain this for Linux or Windows is to install ChefDK (https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)
